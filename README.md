#This file takes in cell phone data from the accelerometers of Sambsung galaxy smartphones. The raw data exists in separate training and testing files that need to be merged. In our run_analysis.R script we read in the raw data and clean it while extracting the mean/standard deviation data points. We also attach a label for the activity to each row. We export the tidy dataset as a txt file
